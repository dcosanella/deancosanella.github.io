               <h2 class="project">ChatApp</h2>
               <p class="description">
                    ChatApp is an Android and desktop application that is designed
                    to allow devices to communicate with other through a server that I
                    have created via sockets. Upon opening the application on
                    either an Android device or desktop, users are asked to create a username
                    that will be assigned to them for that specific session. The user
                    is then able to send either public or private messages to any
                    other username that is currently connected to the server. By
                    default, messages are set as public and will be sent to all users
                    that are connected to the server but that can easily be changed
                    by going to the 'chat with' menu option and typing in a specific
                    username. If you wish to send public messages again, open the
                    'chat with' menu option and keep the text field blank and click
                    OK. With this application, people can get together and come up with
                    their own usernames and communicate with each other either on
                    Android devices or on a desktop.

               <p class="description">
                    I created a bank managment system using multiple C++ libraries.
                    With this system, you can create a bank account with your
                    own account number, your name, and a current balance. You
                    can edit the information in your account and complete deposit
                    and withdrawal transactions and your account will be updated.
                    The bank accounts are written to a text file which is then updated
                    when any information has changed.

               <p class="description">
                    This program was the base for my desktop version of the
                    ChatApp application. With the use of multiple Java libraries,
                    I was able to develop a chat room client and server program.
                    The client takes the input text from the user and sends it to the
                    server. The server then sends that text back to the
                    client as well as any other clients that are connected to
                    the server.

               <p class="description">
                    Super Bag is an HTML5 game that I developed with the Phaser
                    library. The main character of the game is a brown paper
                    bag and the objective of the game is to collect as many
                    apples as you can while avoiding special “gifts” that a
                    bird is trying to drop on you from above.
