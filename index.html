                         Hello and welcome to my personal website. My name
                         is Dean Cosanella. I want to use this website as
                         my personal portfolio to show off the projects that
                         I have worked on in the past as well as my most
                         up to date resume. I plan on keeping this website up to
                         date and I will be posting new projects and versions of
                         my resume when they become available. I want to use this
                         page to talk about myself but please feel free to browse around
                         this site to view all of my work. At the bottom of each
                         page, there is a link to my LinkedIn account if you are
                         interested in viewing that as well. Thank you.

                         <p class="description">
                              In December 2015, I received a Bachelor of
                              Science Degree in Computer Science from California
                              State University, San Bernardino. This is one of
                              my greatest acheivements so far in life. I am
                              currently looking to begin my career as a software
                              developer. Software development is something that
                              I have been very passionate about since I started
                              studying and learning about it in 2012. I have tried
                              to learn as many different programming languages as
                              I can so I will be able to branch out into different
                              fields of software development. On my projects page,
                              you will be able to see that I have tried to create
                              different types of projects to show that I am capable
                              of working on all different types of projects and
                              applications.

                              Something that I struggle with on a daily basis is
                              my speech impediment. I have a stutter when I talk
                              and it makes it very difficult for me to interview
                              for jobs and meet new people. Over the years, I have
                              learned to control my stuttering but I still have a
                              long way to go to be fluent like most people. I know that my
                              stuttering can give people a negative first impression
                              of me when they meet me for the first time. But when
                              people get to know me, they find out that I am a normal
                              person just like everyone else who just has some trouble
                              speaking sometimes. Because of my stutter, I work
                              twice as hard on every project that I work on because
                              I feel like I need to make up for my lack of oral
                              communication skills. I am an extremely hard worker
                              and I am very confident in my abilities as a developer.
                              I know that I can make a positive contribution to
                              anyone who is willing to give me an opportunity.

                              When I am not working on projects or looking for
                              career opportunites, I am with my family and friends.
                              I have an amazing girlfriend who I have been with since
                              2009 and she supports me with everything that I do
                              and I cannot thank her enough for everything she
                              has done for me. I also have the love and support
                              from my family which I am very grateful for as well.
                              I also like to go out with my friends and play all
                              different kinds of sports. I am a fan of the Pittsburgh
                              Steelers, Penguins, and Pirates and I follow their
                              seasons all year long.
