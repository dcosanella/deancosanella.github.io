                         <h2>ChatApp</h2>
                         <p>
                              ChatApp is an Android and desktop application that is designed
                              to allow devices to communicate with other through a server that I
                              have created via sockets. Upon opening the application on
                              either an Android device or desktop, users are asked to create a username
                              that will be assigned to them for that specific session. The user
                              is then able to send either public or private messages to any
                              other username that is currently connected to the server. By
                              default, messages are set as public and will be sent to all users
                              that are connected to the server but that can easily be changed
                              by going to the 'chat with' menu option and typing in a specific
                              username. If you wish to send public messages again, open the
                              'chat with' menu option and keep the text field blank and click
                              OK. With this application, people can get together and come up with
                              their own usernames and communicate with each other either on
                              Android devices or on a desktop.

                         <p>
                              I created a bank managment system using multiple C++ libraries.
                              With this system, you can create a bank account with your
                              own account number, your name, and a current balance. You
                              can edit the information in your account and complete deposit
                              and withdrawal transactions and your account will be updated.
                              The bank accounts are written to a text file which is then updated
                              when any information has changed.

                              I was able to develop a chat room client and server program.
                              The client takes the input text from the user and sends it to the
                              server. The server then sends that text back to the
                              client as well as any other clients that are connected to
                              the server.

                              bird is trying to drop on you from above.

                              Unreal Engine 4. With the use of blueprints, I was able to
                              create a playable character along with characters controlled
                              by artificial intelligence and have them interact with each
                              other in a playable environment. Unfortunately, we were not
                              able to complete the development of DeadMeat but it was a
                              great learning experience for my team and I and we had a
